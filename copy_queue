queue = [1,2,3]

copy_queue = queue.copy()

print(queue)
print(copy_queue)

if queue == copy_queue:
    print('The contents of these objects are the same')
else:
    print('The contents of these objects are different')

print(queue is copy_queue)#It will print false because they are different objects. i.e 

'''OBJECTS ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY OCCUPY DIFFERENT SPACES IN MEMORY 

so it's not that the objects are actually different, it's just that they are in different places in memory?

And is it the fact that objects occupy different spaces in memory, which is the only defining trait that makes them different?

Buddy — that’s an excellent and very insightful question 👏
Let’s unpack it carefully, because you’re really touching the essence of how Python treats objects and identity.

🧩 You said:
So it's not that the objects are actually different, it's just that they are in different places in memory?
✅ That’s almost perfectly right — but let’s sharpen it a little:
When two lists have the same contents but different memory locations, Python treats them as two distinct objects — not just “copies in different places.”

They are structurally identical, but each one lives independently in memory.

If you modify one, the other won’t change:

queue = [1, 2, 3]
copy_queue = queue.copy()

copy_queue.append(4)

print(queue)       # [1, 2, 3]
print(copy_queue)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
That independence — coming from having separate memory — is exactly what defines them as different objects.

So to your second question:
Is the fact that objects occupy different spaces in memory the only defining trait that makes them different?
Yes — in Python, object identity is literally defined by its memory address (ID).
That’s what the is operator checks internally.
If two variables point to the same address → they are the same object.
If they point to different addresses → they are different objects, even if they look the same.

You can confirm this:

queue = [1, 2, 3]
copy_queue = queue.copy()

print(id(queue) == id(copy_queue))  # False
print(queue is copy_queue)          # False

Concept	Meaning	Example
Equality (==)	Same contents	[1,2,3] == [1,2,3] → True
Identity (is)	Same memory address (same actual object)	[1,2,3] is [1,2,3] → False
Different memory = different object	even if the contents are identical	id() values differ


Would you like me to visualize this with a tiny memory diagram (like boxes and arrows showing how the variables point to memory)? It makes it crystal clear.

Yes pls

Awesome 😎 — here’s a simple mental picture of what’s really going on under the hood.
Let’s visualize both cases 👇

🧩 Case 1: copy_queue = queue.copy()
┌───────────────┐         ┌───────────────┐
│   variable    │         │   variable    │
│    queue      │         │  copy_queue   │
└──────┬────────┘         └──────┬────────┘
       │                         │
       ▼                         ▼
┌────────────────────────┐   ┌────────────────────────┐
│   [1, 2, 3] (object A) │   │   [1, 2, 3] (object B) │
│   id = 1001            │   │   id = 2002            │
└────────────────────────┘   └────────────────────────┘
✅ Both objects look the same, but:
They live in different locations in memory.
Changing one won’t affect the other.
queue == copy_queue → True (same contents)
queue is copy_queue → False (different objects)
🧩 Case 2: copy_queue = queue
┌───────────────┐
│   queue       │
│   copy_queue  │
└──────┬────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌────────────────────────┐
│   [1, 2, 3] (object A) │
│   id = 1001            │
└────────────────────────┘
✅ Now both variable names point to the same object in memory:
Changing one will affect the other.
queue == copy_queue → True
queue is copy_queue → True
🧠 Summary
== checks whether the contents match.
is checks whether both names point to the exact same memory address.
So yes — in Python, the only defining difference between “same object” and “different objects” is their memory identity.
