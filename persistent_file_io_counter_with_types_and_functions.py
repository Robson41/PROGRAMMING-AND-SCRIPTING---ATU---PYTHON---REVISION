'''Quiz Question
Program name suggestion:
ðŸ‘‰ score_tracker.py
Question:
Write a Python program called score_tracker.py that keeps track of a player's highest score across multiple runs of the program.
Your program should:
Use a text file (e.g., "highscore.txt") to store and retrieve the highest score.
Read the current highest score from the file when the program starts.
Ask the user to enter their latest game score (as an integer).
Compare the new score with the saved high score.
If the new score is greater, display a congratulatory message and update the file with the new high score.
If the new score is not higher, tell the user their current high score remains unchanged.
The program should handle the case where the file doesnâ€™t exist yet (e.g., on the very first run).
ðŸ§  What this tests:
âœ… Reading and writing files
âœ… File modes (r, w, or wt)
âœ… Type conversion (string â†” int)
âœ… Conditional logic
âœ… Handling missing files gracefully'''

# ======================================================
# Program: persistent_file_io_tracker.py
# Purpose: Track the highest score across runs while
#          demonstrating key Python concepts and pitfalls:
#          - File handling and persistence
#          - Type conversion (str â†” int)
#          - Functions
#          - Conditional logic
#          - Incrementing / comparing numbers
#          - Avoiding nested with-block pitfalls
#          - Correct use of .write() vs .read() return values
# ======================================================

'''Key lessons and errors addressed
Nested with blocks
Writing and immediately nesting reading can fail due to unflushed buffers.
Fixed by using two separate top-level with blocks.
.write() vs .read() return values
.write() â†’ returns number of characters written, not the value itself.
.read() â†’ returns string content, which can be converted to int.
File not existing
Handled with FileNotFoundError.
Empty or corrupted file
Handled with ValueError in read_high_score().
Type conversion
Always convert string â†” int when reading/writing numeric data.
Persistence
File ensures high score remains across program runs.'''
